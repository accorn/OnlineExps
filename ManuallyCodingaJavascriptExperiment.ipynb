    "### What makes a webpage work?\n",

    "As an experiment, right-click somewhere on your browser screen and click on the 'Inspect Element' option from the list that pops up. What you will see pop up is the code that generates what you see on screen. In the 'Inspector' tab of this new pane, you will see the HMTL code that provides the backbone of any webpage. As you hover over some of the text bits, most browser will show you what that code bit is responsible for on screen. However, if we just used HTML to program a page we would probably end up with something like below from the late 90s:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='jupyterImages/oldYahoo.png' width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This will work, but the webpage will essentially be a collection of links to other pages and static text and images. A good example of this is if you ever made a myspace page. You will probably remember the tiled backgrounds and random text everywhere. What made some of those pages really cool though? For me it was adding things in that moved on screen and auto-playing music from a playlist (sorry). What made that kind of stuff possible was javascript. \n",

    "To make a functioning experiment in a web page for online use, we will need to create our experiment using three things: an HTML file to act as the backbone of our experiment, a Javascript file that will hold all of the information we need for an interactive experiment, and a CSS file that helps us make the web page look pretty. \n",

    "\n",
    "HTML files are what the internet browsers read and display on screen. In the below html, we set up the basic structure of of our webpage, call some libraries that are needed, load in our experiment javascript file that we will create, and set up the way we will save our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important notes about HTML:\n",
    "- Everything in HTML can, and often is, part of a hierarchy. This means that things are created in relation to where it lies in the hierarchy. For example, you may have a `<script>` call that is within a `<div>` that is within a `<body>` This may seem a bit odd, but it will make more sense when we start drawing things onscreen. \n",
    "- For the libraries we will call, you will either need to have a local copy of it, or call out to it via a repository on the internet. A lot of these libraries can be called from Google or Cloudflare. If you need a certain package, search the internet for the source address or find a place to manually download it. \n",
    "- The HTML language is a tad different than javascript. Depending on what you want write or have displayed, you need to manually define what each thing is. For example, if you want a heading to show you can use the `<hX>`tags; to show text you can say that it is a paragraph of text using `<p>` and if you want to show an image you can use `<img src='xxxx.jpg'>`\n",
    "- One <b>important</b> thing to remember though is that for our purposes, we are using javascript to modify what html is shown on screen. HTML is what is being shown, the javascript runs everything in the background and modifies the HTML when needed. \n",
    "- If you want to try out some things in a browser to see what happens check [this site out](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default). They allow yout to write out basic scripts and run it immediately to see the changes. They also have a lot of instructional material if you click the house button on the linked page."

    "- In the body section, we will add in the libraries that our experiment will use and the actual experiment javascript file. Each plugin that is used in the experiment will have to be called, as well as any other javascript library that will be used. Think of this section as like calling in R libraries. We only call in the ones we need. You will notice that some of the plugins are called 'keyboard-response' or 'survey-xxx'. These jsPsych plugins make it easy for use to display and record responses from participants. Refer to this [link for a list of jsPsych plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/overview/)<br>\n",
    "- In the script section we will just simply add in the 'timeline:' call that will begin the run through of our experiment. This timeline will be made in the experiment.js file. \n",

    "#### Some brief info about javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript is a programming language that can be used to make webpages interactive. Though, javascript is responsible for running a variety of other applications as well. The javascript language will look familar to people who have programmed in R, matlab, or python. Like python, indexing or arrays begins at 0, but like matlab and R, indenting does not matter. However, one <b>MAJOR</b> difference between javascript and other languages is in how it runs. Everything in javascript is loaded at once rather than line by line like other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that any changes that you want to show in response to a command or button press, must be done through a function call. In general, you will have a piece of code that will display a stimulus and get a response. When that section of the code (or timeline in jsPsych terms) begins, the code will call out to a fucntion to display the right stimuli, and also call a function to get the associated responses. However, as an important note, if your experiment is  fairly simple (read: set stimuli and responses, little randomization, etc.) you may not need as many functions calls as  you could just hard code each or your trial screens. Importantly though, if you have any kind of feedback, corrective or reward based, you will  either need to use a function to show it or use certain jspsych plugins."

    "\n",
    "The main variable to note that we will define, if you opt to use jsPsych, is the `timeline=[]` variable. This variable will eventually hold all of the information that will be shown on screen. If you remember reading that everything in javascript is front loaded, this is where it happens. We will essentially be designing the flow of the entire experiment, and adding each individual trial to this variable. In the HTML in the previous cell we wrote, you may notice a bit of code that says `timeline:timeline`. This line in the HTML calls the timeline variable and begins to show what we added to it. For example, if you have 100 stimuli and associated feedback, you may end up will a 200 item timeline array comprised of 100 stimuli screens and 100 feedback screens. We will set up this info below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>\n",
    "All variables and functions have to be define as such. You will see below that each variable is prepended by a `var`, `const`, or `let` tag. This must be included. The only difference between the usage of each is the implied scope. `const` is technically the new `var` in that they do the same thing in acting as global variables. The use of `let` will redefine an already declared variable. You can use `var` for everything for the purpose of just running an experiment. If not, and some weird errors occur, please let me know and I'll update this section. "

    "This is not a comprehensive list, just some things that have helped me, or things that have caused me issues before when creating experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the browser console and console.log command to help figure out what is going one behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike R and matlab, javascript does not have a workspace that shows you what variables and functions you have made contain. Oftentimes, you may encounter a bug where a conditional isnt working, and it may be due to something like comparing a string to a number. It may not work. However, you may not be able to easily realize this without looking at the value types of what you are comparing. To see what is going on, use the `console.log(varName)` command in around where you think the issue is. Then, load the code in the browser, right click on the screen somewhere and click on 'Inspect Element' or something to that effect (term changes by browser). On the new pane that pops up, find a tab called 'console'. This tab will show every print out of 'console.log(x)' that you tell it to in order. It will also tell you what line of code an error has been found on if one does occur. If you wanted to you could print out every variable at every point to simulate a R-esque workspace.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start simple and then make complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "    This goes for a lot of programming, but javascript even more so in my opinion. Build the most barebones version of your experiment, or even just showing one trial and getting a response over and over again. Once you know that it works, build from that and keep running it to make sure it continues to work. Even though the console will tell you where an error has occured, sometimes it may not help much, or that line may be dependent on a piece of code somewhere else in the code. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Use a linter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some text editor programs have the option to add a plugin called a 'linter'. These plugin scan your code as your write it an flag portions that may be in error such as syntax, missing variable declarations, etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Master GoogleFu and Stack Browsing\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Have a random javascript error or question? Odds are someone else somewhere has had the same one and asked a question on stack exchange. The problem is finding a good answer to that question. A lot of niche programming issues can be solved by searching online. Stack exchange code solutions to some of the problems are fairly effective, but may need some modifications to work with your code. No shame in swiping the code if it works. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Ensure your path is correct and plugins exist\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A big source of errors comes from incorrect path definitions. This is less of an issue is all of your experiment materials are in one folder, but if your separate the stimuli and library files into subfolders, you will need to declare the proper paths so the javascript can find it. If it cant, the code will still run, but it may not run properly. This goes for plugins and online libraries as well. Check the console to see if the online libraries load, and ensure that the plugins that you are wanting to use actually exist in the jsPsych folder. \n"

These determine how things are shown on screen, but also determine how they interact with other elements on screen. This can lead to weird arrangements of stimuli and text. The best solution I have found is to make a 'container' to hold all of the relevant stimuli, then add all of the stimuli to this container. The positional values will then be relative to the container. \n",
    "- Be aware that different screen resolutions can mess with the CSS display. Be sure to test on the lowest resolution and work around that.\n",
    "- For me, this is a lot of trial and error until it looks right."
